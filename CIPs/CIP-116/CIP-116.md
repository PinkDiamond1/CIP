## Simple Summary

Provide a static way to define a string in a JSON schema represents a DID.

## Abstract

This CIP defines a standard way to add a reference to a DID in a JSON schema, so it is possible to access this information about Ceramic streams at build time rather than only at runtime on created streams.

## Motivation

Similar to [CIP-82](../CIP-82/CIP-82.md) providing a static way to describe a runtime value represents a Ceramic StreamID for another schema, using this CIP would allow libraries and applications to have a better semantic understanding of the data in a schema.

For example, the following schema makes it explicit the note `author` is a DID and therefore the application logic can use the DID DataStore to attempt to load the basic profile for the author.

```
{
  $schema: 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#',
  title: 'Notes',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    notes: {
      type: 'array',
      title: 'list',
      items: {
        type: 'object',
        title: 'item',
        properties: {
          author: {
            type: 'string',
            maxLength: 150,
            $comment: 'cip88:did',
          },
          note: { $ref: '#/definitions/NoteDocID' },
          title: {
            type: 'string',
            maxLength: 100,
          },
        },
        required: ['author', 'note'],
      },
    },
  },
  definitions: {
    NoteDocID: {
      type: 'string',
      maxLength: 150,
      $comment: 'cip88:ref:<Note schema streamID>',
    },
  },
}
```

## Specification

References to DIDs should use a `string` with the `$comment` field using the `cip88:did` type.

```js
{
  type: 'string',
  maxLength: 150,
  $comment: 'cip88:did',
}
```

## Rationale

This CIP uses the `$comment` field as defined in [CIP-88](../CIP-88/CIP-88.md).

## Backwards Compatibility

No risk of incompatibilities as this is a new entry in the `cip88` namespace.

## Implementation

None yet.

## Security Considerations

None I'm aware of.
